	  		<h2>Brief Profile of the Entrepreneur</h2>

	  		<p>I was working as a lecturer in a college and was enjoying teaching young students and I could have continued my career teaching. But this irresistible urge within me to do some thing meaningful was allowing me to sit quite. I belong to a rural background . I have always witnessed many problems that the people living in the rural belt have to face and due to scarcity of resources most of the problems are left unaddressed. One of such issues which always bothered me was the condition of illiterate and unsupported women in my area who were deprived of even the basic needs of the life because they was no body to support the, or there were not enough sources to earn or because they were illiterate.</p>

				<p>This inspired me to something legitimate which not only provide monetary gains to these women but also enabled them to live their life with dignity. This is how I started in the year 1991. But with no prior background of business and no experience it was quite difficult to head ahead. I first made a local survey of what business could be started with less investment which fulfils the need of the people who were around me. I observed that there were no potato papads available in the local market which could be a preferred eatable during fasting . And hence I decided to take up this as my product as it could be started even from home with low investment.</p>

				<p>Poised with passion, I made a humble start from my home with an initial seed investment of Rs. 40/- by which I purchased 10 kgs of potatoes, 2 kgs of tapioca sago, 100 gms of black pepper along with other necessary ingredients. Initially, I started making it from my home where I use to boil the potatoes in pressure cooker, make the preparations of the raw material and use to make papads on my own. I started selling it to people around who were known to me. It was very much liked by the people for its unique taste and gradually the demand increased. Finally after few months, the volume of orders was such that I deployed 11 women to make the papad. Within an year of striating this business, I started selling the papad in the local market. It was not easy to balance my job along with this new venture. Hence, I consciously decided to leave my job and resigned on 15th August 1993. The business was progressing but I was facing a lot of problem as I didn't have any background of business, no understanding of typical business related finance, market understating etc. I somehow managed and kept going. But now scalability of the business was my major concern. I was not having any angel investor who could invest and help to expand my business; moreover the overheads were also running high as the business was in the rented space. I have to shift my business many a times from one place to another because it was not possible to continue for more than 6 months in one place as the place owners were not so willing to continue the tenant for more than 6 months. This nomadic shifting of business to different places created many problems and at time I was even frustrated that I though to exit out of this business. But the entrepreneur within me was not ready to give up.</p>

				<p>Finally, I raised money partially from my dealers by taking advance against order and partially from the meagre savings that I have made so far and purchased 2700 square feet of lans in 2001. On one side it was a big reason to be happy but on the other hand I was also worried about how to raise further funds for constructing of sheds and ordering machine. Because increasing production was possible only with the help of machines and it required huge funds. As the saying goes, a penny saved is penny earned, I started saving Rs. 500 from daily income and also me and my husband started to sell papad to people and vendors locally so as to cut down on the cost of dealer. Finally we approached Bank and applied for a home loan of Rs. 5 lacs. I was sanctioned a housing loan of Rs. 5 lacs along with c.c. (cash credit) of Rs. 2 lacs and constructed a small factory and ordered few machines. But time still wanted to test me for my patience. My area suffered a 6 hours of mandatory power shading because of which practically it was impossible to run the factory. We purchased an automatic papad making machine once again with the financial support from Bank and started production after 8p.m in the night till 5 am. Somehow I managed to get over with this phase and finally in the year 2005 I purchased one acre of land in the local MIDC area. I formally registered my company in the year 2010. Things started falling in place for me and I invested heavily in machines because automation was the key for increasing production and increased production was the key to scalability. I initially purchased 3 machines from Khaadi Gramudyog Commission from Wardha, then purchased mini automatic machine from Blue Star Automobile and finally purchased high end automatic machines from Gujarat. I focussed on not only increasing the machine line and production capacity but also generated employment for local women.</p>

				<p>Today, we are known for the largest and unique range of products which have stood the test of the time and are liked for their union mouth watering taste under the name of “ Ganpurti Brand” which is previously known as “ Trupti Papad”.</p>
